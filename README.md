# higher_lower_game_udemy_project_day14:
This is a project from Udemy 100 Days of Code called higher_lower_game. This is a practice project that I build from scratch. Inside this file, Jupyter notebook is also included even though this IDE is primarily used for data analytics, but I find it very useful when you want to test your code in a smaller scale without commenting out other chunks of code that's not intended to be executed. Also, it records the entire thinking process that could be really helpful when you try review or reference the code in the future.<br><br>

The purpose of uploading this beginner's level code is to record my progress along this coding journey!
