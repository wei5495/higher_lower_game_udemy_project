# higher_lower_game_udemy_project
This is a project from Udemy 100 Days of Code called higher_lower_game. This is a practice project that I build from scratch. Inside this file, Jupyter notebook is also included even though this IDE is mainly for data analytics, but I find it very useful to test your code in a smaller scale without commenting out the code that's not intended to be executed, also it demonstrates the entire logic of the code.
